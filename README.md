# Usage
When you run the **loadstring**, an interface shows up that tracks when your LocalPlayer interacts with **`ClickDetector`**, **`ProximityPrompt`**, or **`TouchTransmitter`** objects in the game. The button flashes red when your player is detected.
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Entitynt/Roblox-Fly-Script/refs/heads/main/FlyCommand.lua", true))()
```

# Code Explain
This script is pretty basic. It scans the game for objects like **`ClickDetector`**, **`ProximityPrompt`**, and **`TouchTransmitter`** and alerts you when your LocalPlayer is detected interacting with them. The interface isn't anything special since I'm not too focused on UI design.
